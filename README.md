# Advanced-Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Deep-Learning-and-Attention-Mechanisms
Students must build and evaluate an advanced deep learning model for univariate time-series forecasting using attention mechanisms. They will use complex or synthetic datasets, perform tuning, compare against strong baselines, and clearly explain architectures, attention benefits, and performance across horizons.
